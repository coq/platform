# Overview

The [Coq proof assistant](https://coq.inria.fr) provides a formal language
to write mathematical definitions, executable algorithms, and theorems, together
with an environment for semi-interactive development of machine-checked proofs.

The **Coq Platform** is a distribution of Coq together with a selection of
libraries and plugins. The main goal of the Coq Platform is to provide a
distribution for developing and teaching with Coq that is:

- operating system independent
- dependable
- easy to install
- comprehensive

See the [Charter](charter.md) for more on the Platform concept, and
[CEP 52](https://github.com/coq/ceps/blob/master/text/052-platform-release-cycle.md)
for more on how the Platform is related to the Coq release cycle.

The Coq Platform is based on the OCaml package manager **opam** and provides a set
of scripts to compile and/or install opam, Coq and the platform contents on macOS,
Windows and many Linux distributions in a reliable way with consistent results.
In addition **pre-compiled binary packages** or **installers** are provided for **macOS**,
**Windows** and **snap** for Linux (Docker is in preparation).

The Coq Platform supports installing several versions of Coq - also in parallel,
e.g., for porting developments from one version of Coq to another. For the
previous release version of Coq, Coq Platform provides extended and updated
package picks which are as much as possible compatible to the pick of the latest
release version of Coq. For this reason for some Coq versions several different
package picks are provided.

The table below contains links to the README files for the supported versions
of Coq and libraries. Each README file contains a list of included packages with
detailed information for each package.

- [Coq 8.15.0 (released Jan 2022) with the first package pick from Mar 2022](doc/README~8.15~2022.03.md)
- [Coq 8.14.1 (released Nov 2021) with the first package pick from Jan 2022](doc/README~8.14~2022.01.md)

## Installation

The Coq platform is the recommended way to install Coq for both beginners and experts.
Beginners are encouraged to use one of the binary installers. Experienced users are advised to run the scripts provided by the Coq platform to install from sources as this will allow them to install additional packages with opam.
Please refer to the ReadMe file for your operating system, which contains information on both methods respectively.

- macOS: see [README_macOS](doc/README_macOS.md).
- Windows: see [README_Windows](doc/README_Windows.md)
- Linux: see [README_Linux](doc/README_Linux.md).

<details><summary><font size="+1">Maintaining an installation</font></summary>

It is **not** recommended to `opam upgrage` a Coq Platform opam switch, although this is possible.
The Coq Platform script does not pin any packages - not even Coq.
It just requests to install a specific version, so `opam upgrage` might change a lot of packages
and you end up with something which is no longer an "official" Coq Platform.

Instead it is recommended to wait for the next release of Coq Platform and install it, which will create a new opam switch -
or if you use a binary installer on macOS or Windows, you can choose a different installation folder.
This also has the advantage that you still have the Coq Platform version you have been working with so far available,
which is useful in case you need to port some proofs from the older to the new version - which might happen.
You can remove the opam switch or uninstall an installed Coq Platform as soon as you no longer need it.

In general the Coq Platform team recommends to use the concept of opam switches generously.
If you want to do experiments, create a new switch following the instructions for creating Coq Platform package pick variants below.
You can easily switch between opam switches and do tests.
Also if you follow the package pick variants approach, you can easily share your setup with other people just by sharing the Coq Platform package pick file you created.
A Coq Platform switch requires between 1 and 3 GByte of disk space.
The current Coq 8.13.2 distribution requires 2.3 GByte on macOS.

<details><summary><font size="+1">Features of the Coq Platform</font></summary>

- fully opam based, also on Windows
- single script call to install system dependencies, opam (if not there), a fresh opam switch and the Coq Platform
- interactive (well, script based) guidance of the user through the few parameters
- one unified setup script for Windows, macOS and Linux with few operating system dependent sections only
- for Windows there is an additional wrapper batch script to setup Cygwin as build and working environment
- for Windows there is in addition a classic Windows installer mostly intended for quick installation by beginners
- for macOS a signed (but currently not yet notarized) DMG package is provided, also mostly intended for beginners
- for Linux snap packages are provided via the Snap Store
- it is easy to build variants of the provided installers with modified content
- it is supported to install several versions of Coq in parallel - each will create a separate opam switch - this is intended e.g. for porting Coq developments from older versions of Coq
- system prerequisites are installed using opam depext in a system independent manner
- the script should be fairly robust and safe - it will immediately abort on all errors not explicitly handled
- the script can be restarted if it fails - e.g because of internet or memory issues - it will not redo things it already did

</details>

<details><summary><font size="+1">Using different Coq versions in parallel</font></summary>

Especially for porting projects from an older to a newer version of Coq, Coq Platform supports to install several Coq versions in parallel.
You can also use a Coq version from a previous version of Coq Platform in parallel with a Coq version from a newer version of Coq Platform.
Each Coq version you install via the Coq Platform scripts will create a separate opam switch.

You can list the available switches with:
```
~$ opam switch
#   switch                                   compiler                    description
    __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.12            ocaml-base-compiler.4.10.2  __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.12
    __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.13~2021.02    ocaml-base-compiler.4.10.2  __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.13~2021.02
    __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.13~2021.09    ocaml-base-compiler.4.10.2  __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.13~2021.09
    __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.13~2022.01    ocaml-base-compiler.4.10.2  __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.13~2022.01
    __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.14~2022.01    ocaml-base-compiler.4.10.2  __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.14~2022.01
    __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.15~beta1   ocaml-base-compiler.4.10.2  __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.15~beta1
->  __coq-platform.2022.01.0~dev             ocaml-base-compiler.4.10.2  __coq-platform.2022.01.0~dev
```

You can select the opam switch for **all shells** with e.g.:
```
~$ opam switch __coq-platform.2021.09.0~8.14+beta2
```

You can select the opam switch for **just the current shell** with e.g.:
```
eval $(opam config env --set-switch --switch __coq-platform.2021.09.0~8.13)
```

So you can easily open two separate shell windows, select different opam switches and start e.g. two CoqIDE instances to step through the same file with two different versions of Coq.

<details><summary><font size="+1">Installation of additional packages or package variants</font></summary>

## CompCert and VST variants

For some packages, notably CompCert and VST (the Princeton tool-chain for verification of C code), exist various variants.

By default the 64 bit variant of CompCert and the 64 bit variant of VST are installed.

You can install the 32 bit variants in addition any time later by issuing `opam install` commands, e.g.
```
opam install coq-compcert-32.3.9
opam install coq-vst-32.2.8
```
Please note that since both variants can be installed in parallel, only one, the 64 bit variant, is immediately available to Coq
without -Q and -R options.
If you want to work with the 32 bit variants, please use these options in your Coq project:
```
-Q $(coqc -where)/../coq-variant/compcert32/compcert compcert
-Q $(coqc -where)/../coq-variant/VST32/VST VST
```

**Important note:** CompCert is **not** free / open source software, but may be used for research and evaluation purposes.
Please clarify the license at [CompCert License](https://github.com/AbsInt/CompCert/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Installation of other packages

- On Windows open a shell with `C:\<your_coq_platform_cygwin_path>\cygwin.bat`.
- On Linux or macOS open a shell in the usual way.
- Run the command `opam switch` which will show the list of available switches:
    ```
    ~$ opam switch
    #   switch                                   compiler                    description
        __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.12            ocaml-base-compiler.4.10.2  __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.12
        __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.13~2021.02    ocaml-base-compiler.4.10.2  __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.13~2021.02
        __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.13~2021.09    ocaml-base-compiler.4.10.2  __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.13~2021.09
        __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.13~2022.01    ocaml-base-compiler.4.10.2  __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.13~2022.01
        __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.14~2022.01    ocaml-base-compiler.4.10.2  __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.14~2022.01
        __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.15~beta1   ocaml-base-compiler.4.10.2  __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.15~beta1
    ->  __coq-platform.2022.01.0~dev             ocaml-base-compiler.4.10.2  __coq-platform.2022.01.0~dev
    ```
- Choose the switch you want to change with this command (example):
    ```
    opam switch __coq-platform.2022.01.0~8.14~2022.01
    eval $(opam env)
    ```
- You can find packages with `opam list --all | grep "some keyword"`.
- You can show the description and further details on a package with `opam show "package"`.
- Install additional packages with `opam install "package"`.
- You can find some additional information on managing Coq installation with opam at [Install Coq with opam](https://coq.inria.fr/opam-using.html).

</details>

<details><summary><font size="+1">Creating package pick variants</font></summary>

It is an intended use case of the Coq Platform to create custom variants, e.g.
for projects or lectures, by creating additional files in the [package_picks](package_picks)
folder.

The scripts for creating binary packages and installers should be able to
handle such variants, so that it should be easy to create a custom installer
e.g. for a lecture.

A few notes on the process:

- Create a new file in the [package_picks](package_picks) folder by copying one of the existing files as template.
- Add or remove packages or change package versions according to your requirements.
- You should include specific versions for all packages to get a reproducible result.
  The opam database changes daily and unless you specify a version for each package you get different results and possibly the build will fail.
- In case you want to include pre release packages, which don't have a published opam package as yet, you can add opam packages in the folders under [opam](opam).
  opam packages in thes folder take precedence over packages from the published repositories.
- You can set the variable `COQ_PLATFORM_USE_DEV_REPOSITORY` in the header of the package pick file to `Y` in case you want to include the public and local `extra-dev` opam repositories in the opam package search.
- **Please always change the opam switch name**, that is the variable `COQ_PLATFORM_PACKAGE_PICK_POSTFIX`!
- The scripts for creating binary packages/installers for macOS, Windows and snap are in the specific system sub folders:
  - **macOS**: (macos/create_installer_macos.sh)
  - **Windows**: (windows/create_installer_windows.sh)
  - **snap**: (linux/create_snapcraft_yaml.sh)
  - the macOS and Windows script are intended to be run locally and require that the specific Coq Platform version has been installed and that **the opam switch is selected**,
    but the CI actions also create the installers for macOS and Windows.
  - the snap package is intended to be created via a CI action - see (linux/snap/github_actions/README.md)
  - the scripts don't take required parameters (some have debug parameters)

A note on debugging `Sorry, no solution found: there seems to be a problem with your request.`: this happens mostly in a parallel build, when you request e.g. package versions which have incompatible dependencies. The best way to debug this is to set in [coq_platform_make.sh](https://github.com/coq/platform/blob/0895c3cc0d69837ed7a80d882d4348d90e4a609a/coq_platform_make.sh#L22) `export OPAMYES=0` and then do a sequential build (select 's' when the scripts asks). opam will stop then whenever additional dependencies need to be installed and especially if the version of an already installed packages needs to be changed.
