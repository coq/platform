# Coq platform

The Coq platform is a distribution of the Coq proof assistant together with a selection of Coq libraries.
It provides a set of scripts to compile and install OPAM, Coq, Coq libraries and Coq plugins on MacOS,
Windows and many Linux distributions in a reliable way with consistent results.

See [Charter](charter.md) for the coq platform concept.

# Installation

The Coq platform is the recommended way to install Coq for both beginners and experts.
Beginners are encouraged to use one of the binary installers. Experienced users are advised to run the scripts provided by the Coq platform to install from sources as this will allow them to install additional packages with opam.
Please refer to the ReadMe file for your OS, which contains information on both methods respectively.

- macOS: see [README_macOS](README_macOS.md).
- Windows: see [README_Windows](README_Windows.md)
- Linux: see [README_Linux](README_Linux.md).

See the [Customization](#customization) section on how to obtain a custom setup with more or less packages installed.

# Note on Licenses

The Coq platform setup scripts and the selection of packages and patches are licensed Creative Commons CC0.
This license does **not** apply to the packages installed by the Coq platform.
You can get an overview over the licenses of the installed software (after installing it)
with the command:
```
opam list --columns=name,license:
```
In case no license is given please clarify on the homepage of the software:
```
opam list --columns=name,homepage:
```
Please note that some opam packages require and install system packages with many dependencies (e.g GTK3).
These dependencies might have various licenses. You need to refer to your system package manager to
inspect the licenses of such packages.

- one unified setup script for Windows, macOS and Linux with few OS dependent sections only
- on Windows there is an additional wrapper batch script to setup Cygwin as build and working environment
- on Windows there is in addition a classic Windows installer mostly intended for quick installation by beginners
- it is easy to build variants of the Windows installer with modified content from an existing opam switch
- system prerequisites are installed using opam depext in a system independent manner
- the script should be fairly robust and safe - it will immediately abort an all errors not explicitly handled
- the script can be restarted if it fails - e.g cause of internet issues - it will not redo things it already did
- the scripts are modular and easy to configure for specific needs, e.g. a reduced or extended setup for a lecture - see [`variants.md`](/variants.md)

## Changes from 2021.02.1 to 2021.02.2

- support for opam 2.1.0 (which integrates the opam system dependency manager *depext* - this needed a few adjustments)
- fix issues with Cygwin binutils
- various minor fixes for the Snap package (support gappa, clightgen, ...)
- various minor fixes to the Windows installer (add icon for CoqIDE, ...)
- minor cleanup and improvements of the Coq Platform scripts
- the versions of provided Coq packages are identical to 2021.02.1

## Changes from 2021.02.0 to 2021.02.1

- added DMG package / installer for macOS
- Coq and CoqIDE update to version 8.13.2 (bugfix release)
- VST updated to version 2.7.1 (bugfix release)
- new package `coq-hott` *The Homotopy Type Theory library*

# Customization

## Installation of additional packages or package variants

### CompCert and VST variants

For some packages, notably CompCert and VST (the Princeton tool-chain for verification of C code), exist various variants.
By default the 64 bit variant of CompCert and the 64 bit variant of VST are installed.

CompCert is **not** free / open source software, but may be used for research and
evaluation purposes. Please clarify the license at [CompCert License](https://github.com/AbsInt/CompCert/blob/master/LICENSE).

Please note that CompCert is required for the (open source) C verification
tool chain VST. If you don't install CompCert, you can't install VST.
If you want to use VST with the provided VST examples only, you require only
parts of CompCert, which are dual licensed and open source. In case you want
to verify your own C code with VST, you need non open source parts of
CompCert, notably the `clightgen` program. CompCert does not support
installing only its open source parts, since evaluation usage is explicitly
allowed in the license (see link above).

The script will ask if you want to install CompCert.

The compilation of VST takes quite a while on slow / small RAM PCs. For this reason the script also asks if you want to install VST.

You can change the selection of packages any time later by issuing `opam install` commands, e.g.
```
opam install coq-compcert.3.8
opam install coq-vst.2.7.1
```

There is also a 32 bit variant of CompCert and VST, which can be installed by running these commands:
```
opam install coq-compcert-32.3.8
opam install coq-vst-32.2.7.1
```
or by adjusting [`coq_platform_packages.sh`](/coq_platform_packages.sh) accordingly.
Please note that since both variants can be installed in parallel, only one, the 64 bit variant, is immediately available to Coq
without -Q and -R options. If you want to work with the 32 bit variants, please use these options in your Coq project:
```
-Q $(coqc -where)/../coq-variant/compcert32/compcert compcert
-Q $(coqc -where)/../coq-variant/VST32/VST VST
```

### Installation of other packages

- On Windows open a shell with `C:\<your_coq_platform_cygwin_path>\cygwin.bat`.
- On Linux or macOS open a shell in the usual way.
- Run these commands:
    ```
    opam switch _coq-platform_.2021.02.2
    eval $(opam env)
    ```
- Install additional packages with `opam install "package"`
- You can find packages with `opam list --all | grep "some keyword"`
