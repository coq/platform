cat <<EOH
============================== CLOSING REMARKS ===============================
The Coq Platform installation script finished successfully!

A new opam switch with name "${COQ_PLATFORM_SWITCH_NAME}" has been created.
You can list all available opam switches with "opam switch".
You can change the default opam switch to the newly created switch with:

    opam switch ${COQ_PLATFORM_SWITCH_NAME}
    eval \$(opam env)

Or to just use an opam switch in the current shell (not setting the default):

    eval \$(opam config env --set-switch --switch ${COQ_PLATFORM_SWITCH_NAME})

You can list the packages in the currently selected opam switch with:

    opam list

You can install additional packages with:

    opam install <package>

There is a dedicated Zulip stream for the Coq Platform:
