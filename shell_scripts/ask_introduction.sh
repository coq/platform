====================== JUST COQ OR COMPLETE PLATFORM ? =======================
This script installs the Coq Platform release $COQ_PLATFORM_RELEASE, that is:

- the Coq compiler and Coq's standard library (b)
- optionally CoqIDE, a GTK3 based graphical user interface (i)
- optionally various widely used Coq libraries and plugins (f)
- optionally an extended set of Coq libraries and plugins (x)

The script uses opam, the OCaml package manager, to do all the work.
In case opam is not yet installed, it will install opam.
A new opam switch will be created unless a Coq Platform switch already exists.

This script is tested on Windows 10, macOS and many Linux variants.

The script compiles everything from sources, which might takes less than one
hour on a fast machine with lot's of RAM, or up to 6 hours with little RAM.

Instead of installing the full or extended Coq Platform now, you can install
just Coq (+ CoqIDE) and install additional packages via opam later as needed.
You should install CoqIDE unless you know what VSCoq or Proof General is.
