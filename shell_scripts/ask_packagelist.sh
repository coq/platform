========================= SELECT PACKAGE_PICK VERSION ==========================
The Coq Platform allows to install the latest release version of Coq, but also
older or development versions of Coq. Besides the Coq version, you can choose
a 'package pick', that is a selection of specific versions of Coq libraries,
plugins and tools. For some versions of Coq several package picks are available.
Package picks with the same release date for different Coq versions are made
as compatible as possible.
You can install several versions of Coq in parallel, which simplifies porting of
developments. You can use "opam switch" to switch between Coq versions.

The following Coq versions and package picks are available:
EOH

  packagefile_list="$( (for file in package_picks/package-pick-*.sh; do echo "$(grep "COQ_PLATFORM_VERSION_SORTORDER=" $file) $file"; done) | tr '=' ' ' | sed 's/  */ /g' | sort -n | cut -d ' ' -f 3)"

  packageindex=0
  for packagefile in ${packagefile_list}
  do
      if ! grep -q "COQ_PLATFORM_VERSION_SORTORDER=" "$packagefile"; then echo "ERROR: package file '$packagefile' does not contain 'COQ_PLATFORM_VERSION_SORTORDER' definition."; fail; fi
      if ! grep -q "COQ_PLATFORM_VERSION_TITLE=" "$packagefile"; then echo "ERROR: package file '$packagefile' does not contain 'COQ_PLATFORM_VERSION_TITLE' definition."; fail; fi
      packageindex=$((${packageindex} + 1))
      notes="$(grep 'COQ_PLATFORM_VERSION_TITLE=' "${packagefile}" | tr '=' ' ' | tr -d '"' | sed 's/  */ /g' | cut -d ' ' -f 2-)"
      echo "(${packageindex}): $notes"
  done
