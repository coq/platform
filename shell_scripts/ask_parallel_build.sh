=============================== PARALLEL BUILD ===============================
The Coq platform opam build has two levels of parallelism:

- parallel build of (independent) opam packages
- parallel build inside the make of each opam package

Since a single coqc call can take more than 1 GB of RAM and since the two
above kinds of parallelism multiply, the total amount of memory can be large.
But it is not as bad as one might expect: test show that a full parallel
build takes less than 14GB of RAM with 15 parallel make jobs.

With 32 GB or RAM a parallel package build with 16 make jobs is recommended.
With 16 GB of RAM a parallel package build with 4 make jobs is recommended.
With 8 GB of RAM a sequential package build with 4 make jobs is recommended.
With 4 GB+1GB swap a sequential packahge build with 2 make jobs is recommended.
With less RAM, you might have to remove failing packages, e.g. VST.
In order to remove packages, just edit this script at "PACKAGE SELECTION".
