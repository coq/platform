			================================ OPAM SWITCH =================================
			The Coq platform creates the opam switch $COQ_PLATFORM_SWITCH_NAME.

			Apparently this switch already exists. It is recommended to delete the switch,
			so that you get a clean and well defined result.

			For incremental builds after a failure, e.g. cause of RAM size issues, it is
			no problem to keep the switch.
