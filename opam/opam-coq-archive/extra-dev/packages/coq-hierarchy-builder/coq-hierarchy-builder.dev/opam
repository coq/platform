synopsis: "High level commands to declare and evolve a hierarchy based on packed classes"
description: """
Hierarchy Builder is a high level language to build hierarchies of algebraic structures and make these
hierarchies evolve without breaking user code. The key concepts are the ones of factory, builder
and abbreviation that let the hierarchy developer describe an actual interface for their library.
Behind that interface the developer can provide appropriate code to ensure retro compatibility.
