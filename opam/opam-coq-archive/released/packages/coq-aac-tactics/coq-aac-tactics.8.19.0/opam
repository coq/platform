synopsis: "Coq tactics for rewriting universally quantified equations, modulo associative (and possibly commutative and idempotent) operators"
description: """
This Coq plugin provides tactics for rewriting and proving universally
quantified equations modulo associativity and commutativity of some operator,
with idempotent commutative operators enabling additional simplifications.
The tactics can be applied for custom operators by registering the operators and
their properties as type class instances. Instances for many commonly used operators,
such as for binary integer arithmetic and booleans, are provided with the plugin."""
