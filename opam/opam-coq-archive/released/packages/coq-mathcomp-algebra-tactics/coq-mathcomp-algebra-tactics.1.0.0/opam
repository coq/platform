synopsis: "Ring and field tactics for Mathematical Components"
description: """\
This library provides `ring` and `field` tactics for Mathematical Components,
that work with any `comRingType` and `fieldType` instances, respectively.
Their instance resolution is done through canonical structure inference.
Therefore, they work with abstract rings and do not require `Add Ring` and
`Add Field` commands. Another key feature of this library is that they
automatically push down ring morphisms and additive functions to leaves of
ring/field expressions before normalization to the Horner form."""
