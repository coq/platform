synopsis: "The Coq Proof Assistant -- Core Binaries and Tools"
description: """
Coq is a formal proof management system. It provides
a formal language to write mathematical definitions, executable
algorithms and theorems together with an environment for
semi-interactive development of machine-checked proofs.

Typical applications include the certification of properties of
programming languages (e.g. the CompCert compiler certification
project, or the Bedrock verified low-level programming library), the
formalization of mathematics (e.g. the full formalization of the
Feit-Thompson theorem or homotopy type theory) and teaching.

This package includes the Coq core binaries, plugins, and tools, but
not the vernacular standard library.

Note that in this setup, Coq needs to be started with the -boot and
-noinit options, as will otherwise fail to find the regular Coq
prelude, now living in the coq-stdlib package."""
